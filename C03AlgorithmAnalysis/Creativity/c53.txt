We use the truth table method.
Let's say we have 8 bottles and 3 taste testers :

Tester 1 drinks : 1 2 3 4 and not 5 6 7 8
Tester 2 drinks : 1 2 5 6 and not 3 4 7 8
Tester 3 drinks : 1 3 5 7 and not 2 4 6 8

Each pattern of dead testers yields exactly one culprit bottle.
Example : 1 survives, 2 and 3 die. Then it is bottle 5.
